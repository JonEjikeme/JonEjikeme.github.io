# Video Surveillance Security System 

A friend of mine requested my assistance in implementing a video surveillance system at a client's residence. We have prior experience with installing surveillance cameras in residential settings where we have utilized both Wireless and Ethernet-based cameras. This background allowed us to leverage our prior knowledge in this security system implementation.

## Equipment

For this installation, we utilized a system consisting of eight Power over Ethernet (PoE) cameras, paired with a Network Video Recorder (NVR). Our first task was to run a network cable from the router, which was located in the attic. This required drilling access holes in the ceiling to ensure a clean and secure cable route.

## Planning and installation

The client provided specific areas of the house where he wanted the cameras to be positioned. This allowed us to carefully plan the optimal camera placements. A significant portion of the project involved running the network cables to the designated camera locations. To ensure the wires remained hidden, we strategically tucked them into various sections of the house.
The client also requested that we install some cameras to an area detached from the main house. In order for us to get cameras out to the detached site, we ran the network cable underground through conduit piping. This was done to protect the cables from exposure to weather conditions while maintaining organization and ensuring the wires could be easily accessed and removed if necessary.

## NVR Setup

Setting up the NVR was straightforward, and it included an app that allowed remote viewing from any location. Given that the client is not very tech-savvy, we decided to offer complimentary technical support for the camera system to ensure they would be able to fully utilize the system without difficulty.


## Reflection

This experience reinforced my understanding that cybersecurity isnt’ just about defending digital assets. It’s also about securing the physical infrastructure that supports those assets. This project has deepened my appreciation for the interconnectedness of physical and cyber protection.
