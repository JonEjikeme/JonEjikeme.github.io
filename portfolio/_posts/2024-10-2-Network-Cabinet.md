# Network Cabinet 

<img src="/assets/img/portfolio/NetworkCabinet/NetworkCabinet.JPG" alt="Network Cabinet"> 

As an Information Technology intern, one of my primary responsibilities is to support the network engineer in various tasks. For this specific project, we were assigned the implementation of a new network cabinet within an employee building. The project spanned approximately one week, during which I gained valuable insights into the organization’s network infrastructure and its deployment. 

# Setting up the Network

This project involved the installation of CAT 6 Ethernet cables, terminating them with RJ45 connectors, and routing them to a patch panel. Patch panels are essential components in network infrastructure, providing an organized means for labeling and connecting network cables to various network devices. The patch panel utilized in this project was a keystone-style panel, meaning the individual ports are unoccupied and require Ethernet cables to be terminated into keystone jacks before being inserted into the panel. Terminating Ethernet cables onto a keystone jack is a straightforward process. Following the TIA/EIA-568-B standard, which is the established wiring standard within our organization, we performed the punch-down procedure on each jack. The terminated cables were then routed to a network switch, which was connected to the LAN port of the firewall device.

# Challenges and Troubleshooting

While the building was already pre-wired with CAT 6 cabling, the previous network engineer had not properly organized the ports. As a result, when we began installing the new network cabinet, we encountered numerous cables that were either not terminated, inconsistently labeled, or completely unlabeled. My colleague and I spent a significant amount of time tracing the Ethernet cables to identify their destinations and determine their functionality. After identifying key ports—such as those for access points (AP), office spaces, and common areas—we terminated them onto keystone jacks and installed them into the patch panel. Towards the end of the installation, we encountered a network loop, which presented a significant challenge. To resolve the issue, we systematically tested each port to trace the origin of the loop. After careful troubleshooting, we identified and removed the faulty cable causing the loop, which restored normal network functionality.

# Lessons Learned

This project provided valuable insights into the fundamentals of network security by allowing me to observe firsthand how network devices operate and how traffic is filtered through firewalls. Troubleshooting the network loop involved systematically identifying and eliminating potential failure points, a process that mirrors how vulnerabilities and misconfigurations are identified and mitigated in cybersecurity. I also gained an understanding of the critical role that proper documentation and labeling play in maintaining network infrastructure within an organization. The skills acquired during this experience have enabled me to contribute to additional projects alongside the network engineer. Moreover, my exposure to networking has not only deepened my appreciation for the work engineers perform but also strengthened my aspiration to secure networks and information systems.
