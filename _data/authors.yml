  about:             |
    I’m an ambitious Information Technology student at the New York Institute of Technology with a strong passion for building secure and resilient digital environments. 
    This spring, I’ll be graduating with a Bachelor's in Information Technology. By 2026, I’ll be earning my Master’s in Cybersecurity.
    My focus lies in deploying secure networks and system configurations that not only protect but also enhance user experiences. 
    Committed to continuous learning, I’m always exploring new ways to make technology safer and more efficient for everyone. 
    I’m eager to apply my skills in real-world security challenges and contribute to strengthening digital systems.
